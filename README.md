## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various medical parameters. The goal is to provide a reliable, data-driven approach to assist healthcare professionals in early diabetes detection, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.

## Motivation
The rising prevalence of diabetes worldwide highlights the need for efficient and accurate detection methods. Early diagnosis is crucial in managing diabetes effectively and preventing complications. This project leverages machine learning to create a model that can predict diabetes risk, helping to streamline diagnosis and personalize treatment plans.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Database**, which is widely used for diabetes prediction. It includes the following features:
- `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- `Age`: Age (years)
- `Outcome`: Class variable (0 or 1), where 1 indicates diabetes

## Modeling
Several machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing model.

## Results
The **Random Forest** classifier yielded the best results, with an accuracy of approximately **85%**. This model was selected for further optimization and deployment.

- **Accuracy:** 85%
- **Precision:** 82%
- **Recall:** 78%
- **F1 Score:** 80%

## Future Work
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Further optimize the Random Forest model using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
- **Feature Engineering:** Explore additional features or derive new features to improve model performance.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the final model as a web application for real-time diabetes prediction.
- **Integration with Healthcare Systems:** Explore possibilities to integrate the model into existing healthcare systems for practical use.
